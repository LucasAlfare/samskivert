Required external libraries
---------------------------

The samskivert code requires external Java libraries (JAR files) to be placed
here in the lib/ directory. The libraries are enumerated in the
etc/libs-incl.xml file and must be named as specified in that file.

Those libraries can be obtained at the following websites:

- http://ant.apache.org/
- http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/
- http://jakarta.apache.org/commons
- http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity
- http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/
- http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/
- http://junit.org/

The latest versions of the libraries should work, except where specific
versions are specified in the libs-incl.xml file.
