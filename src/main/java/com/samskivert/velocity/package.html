    Provides parts of a simple web application framework built around the
    Velocity template engine.

    <p> The web application framework provided by this package is simple
      and intended for use in small projects with limited scope. It is not
      intended to be all things, nor to evolve into something that makes
      toast. It builds upon Velocity, a template engine whose
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/design.html">philosophies</a>
      about the separation of markup and code I agree with.

    <p> Velocity is designed to be used explicitly by servlets in
      applications where the design is structured around the servlets
      rather than the pages generated by the servlets. This is in contrast
      to the JSP approach where the pages themselves dictate the structure
      of the application and the servlets are automatically generated to
      conform to that structure. This package provides a means by which to
      automatically map serlvet-like units of code to templates in a way
      akin to JSP's approach but without the combination of code and
      markup.
