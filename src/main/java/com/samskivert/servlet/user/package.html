    Provides services for managing a database of users in a web
    application or suite of web applications.

    <p> This is accomplished through the
      {@link com.samskivert.servlet.user.UserManager} which can be used to
      load user objects, create new users, update existing users and
      generally all of the user-related things that you'd like to do. The
      user manager manages cookies for persistent or session-only
      authentication and provides support for requiring that a user be
      authenticated in order to access a page.

    <p> The user manager stores user information in an SQL database which
      is accomplished by the
      {@link com.samskivert.servlet.user.UserRepository} class. Presently,
      it assumes that it is making use of a MySQL database, but the
      dependencies are minimal. Eventually I'll modify the repository
      abstraction so that the database-specific support code can be chosen
      at runtime rather than compile time. Why I designed it the way it is
      in the first place, I can't imagine. I'm a bad monkey.

    <p> The user table (and associated
      {@link com.samskivert.servlet.user.User} object) are inentionally
      minimal. The expectation is that application specific data will be
      stored and accessed via some other table that is keyed on the userid
      provided by these services.
