The samskivert Project
----------------------

The samskivert Project (TSP) aims to provide useful reusable Java routines
that do things for which I've been unable to find useful reusable
implementations on the net.

Given the emphasis on reusability, TSP attempts to closely adhere to the
following principles:

* Each individual module should depend as little as possible on other TSP
  modules. Obvious exceptions include modules that are a logical extension
  of other modules and modules that clearly require a service that is
  implemented by another TSP module and would have to implement that
  service themselves in the absence of dependence on the other module.

* Modules should be both simple to use and as general purpose as possible.
  To meet these two competing requirements, a balance must be struck at
  that sweet spot where reusability is maximized.

* Code included in TSP will freely depend on JDK packages available in the
  Java 2 platform and beyond. TSP is initially a repository of software
  useful for server-side or stand alone applications and therefore need
  not compromise because it needs to function in the JVMs of commonly
  available web browsers.

* We are not here to reinvent the wheel, nor to provide a uniform
  interface to every software service under the sun. If something is
  available in a freely redistributable and reusable form from someone
  else, it won't be found in TSP. If TSP depends on such software from
  another source, it will provide clear documentation on how to get that
  software and make use of it within the scope of TSP's particular needs.
  Again a balance of reusability will be struck here and software that is
  sufficiently difficult to make usable in an arbitrary environment will
  not be used by TSP and may be "reinvented".

Distribution
------------

TSP is released under the GPL.

Contribution
------------

Contributions to TSP are welcome. Control of the CVS repository is
presently in the hands of TSP's creator, mdb@samskivert.com and
submissions will be reviewed prior to inclusion. Facilities for management
of major contributions by external parties will, of course, be provided
when such contributions exist.
